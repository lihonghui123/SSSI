# Seismic Simulation, Survey, and Imaging (S3I) 
## Purpose of S3I
At the [Center for Energy and Geo Processing (CeGP)](https://cegp.ece.gatech.edu/) and at the [OLIVES lab](https://ghassanalregib.com/), we created the S3I tool in order to: 
  * Provides an easy MATLABÂ®-based library to simulate seismic imaging
  * Produces synthesized data for any given velocity model
  * Targets students as well as professionals in exploration geophysics
  * Provides an efficient implementation of the processing pileline for seismic imaging
  * Provides a platform to build other features such as interpretation and reservoir modeling
